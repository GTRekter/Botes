Ever since I was a little kid, technology has been a fundamental part of my life. After studying Computer Science, my hunger and curiosity made me complete multiple college certifications at MIT and UCSD on Cloud Computing and C# programming. During my career, I worked for numerous consultancy and fintech companies worldwide, and since 2021 I am working as a Customer Engineer at Microsoft. In addition to my work required duties, I am also an active member of the development community. I periodically write articles, reply to StackOverflow questions, and conduct live workshops and keynotes for international audiences on topics like Azure, DevOps, and coding best practices.
